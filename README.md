seqminer_perl
=============

Summary
-------

`seqminer_perl` is a framework for the identification of sequences from protein families. It was developed to generate the dataset used to populate the [varDB](http://www.vardb.org) database of antigenic variant families.

Release history
---------------

This repository serves as an archive (tag `release_1`) of the code used for the first release of varDB (before 2010). The initial implementation was done in Perl. Later, I changed to Ruby, and so the [seqminer](https://github.com/ddiez/seqminer) project superseded this one.
